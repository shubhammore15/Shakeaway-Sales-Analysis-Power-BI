## Introduction

This project encapsulates a comprehensive sales analysis for Shakeaway, visualized through Power BI Desktop. The primary aim is to examine sales trends, customer behaviors, and product performance to drive informed business decisions.

## Problem

Shakeaway faced the challenge of understanding its sales dynamics in depth. The company needed to analyze various aspects of sales, such as total takings, product category performance, and customer type contributions, to enhance its operational and marketing strategies.

## Role

My role was responsible for collating, processing, and analyzing Shakeaway's sales data, translating it into actionable insights through visual reporting.

## Contribution

Key contributions to the Shakeaway Sales Analysis project included:
- **Data Processing**: Organizing and cleaning sales data for accurate analysis.
- **Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzing sales data across different categories like drinks, frozen yogurt, milkshakes, shaved ice, and smoothies.
- **Customer Analysis**: Distinguishing between new and returning customers and their contribution to sales.
- **Payment Method Analysis**: Assessing the distribution of payments made via cash and card.

## Outcome

The project led to several key findings:
- Milkshakes were the top-selling category, contributing significantly to the total sales.
- A balanced mix of new and returning customers, highlighting the importance of both customer retention and acquisition.
- A higher proportion of sales transactions were made using cards compared to cash.
These insights provide Shakeaway with a clear understanding of their sales landscape, aiding in strategic decision-making to optimize sales and marketing efforts.
